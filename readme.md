# Axiom01 UI Framework
Welcome to Axiom01, a modern and flexible UI framework designed for building beautiful, accessible, and themeable web interfaces.

## Overview
Axiom01 is a lightweight CSS and JavaScript framework that focuses on:
- **Theming**: Built-in support for multiple themes including light, dark, and specialty themes
- **Accessibility**: ARIA-compliant components and keyboard navigation
- **Flexibility**: CSS variables for easy customization
- **Modularity**: Use only what you need

## The Axiom Philosophy

Axiom01 is built on several core principles that make it different from other UI frameworks:

### Minimal Class Usage

Unlike many CSS frameworks that require numerous utility classes, Axiom01 leverages the power of semantic HTML and CSS variables. This approach:

- Reduces HTML bloat by minimizing the number of classes needed
- Promotes cleaner, more maintainable markup
- Encourages proper semantic HTML structure
- Makes your code more readable and easier to maintain

### CSS Variables Over Classes

Axiom01 uses CSS custom properties (variables) extensively to:
- Create consistent design patterns
- Enable easy theming and customization
- Allow for dynamic style changes without JavaScript
- Provide a clean way to override defaults without specificity issues

### Accessibility First

Accessibility isn't an afterthoughtâ€”it's built into the framework from the ground up:
- ARIA attributes are implemented in all interactive components
- Keyboard navigation works out of the box
- Color contrast meets WCAG guidelines
- Focus states are clearly visible

### Performance Focused

Axiom01 is designed to be lightweight and performant:
- Minimal JavaScript dependencies
- No external libraries required
- Optimized CSS with low specificity
- Only the components you need
